    A Graph is represented by a dict where the keys are Points in the Graph
    and the dict values are sets containing Edges incident on each Point.
    A separate set *edges* contains all Edges in the graph.

    The input must be a list of polygons, where each polygon is a list of
    in-order (clockwise or counter clockwise) Points. If only one polygon,
    it must still be a list in a list, i.e. [[Point(0,0), Point(2,0),
    Point(2,1)]].

    *polygons* dictionary: key is a integer polygon ID and values are the
    edges that make up the polygon. Note only polygons with 3 or more Points
    will be classified as a polygon. Non-polygons like just one Point will be
    given a polygon ID of -1 and not maintained in the dict.
